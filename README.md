## The Game

### Synopsis
The world has been invaded by nearly indestructable, one-hit killers from outer space.
Upon joining the server, you are part of a group of desperate lone survivors of the invasion whose
only mission is to save the world.. one alien at a time.

We do not know much about these alien lifeforms.  We know that they are very difficult to kill. If one of these creatures spots you, they will begin chasing you and will kill you in a single hit.  The best advise is to run away to a safe distance unless you are prepared to fight.  It has been reported that when these creatures die, they may drop an important clue that will help you on your mission.

You will be backed by the reinforcements from the military.  They will drop supplies (health and weapons) occassionally.  If you hear aircraft overhead or see fireworks, head towards the drop - but be warned, these areas are NOT safezones.
