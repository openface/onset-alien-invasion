## The Game

### Synopsis
The world has been invaded by nearly indestructable, one-hit killers from outer space.

Upon joining the server, you will be part of a group of desperate lone survivors of the invasion whose only mission is to save the world.

We do not know much about these alien lifeforms.  We do know that they are very difficult to kill. If one of these creatures spots you, they will begin chasing you and may kill you instantly.  The best advice is to run away to a safe distance unless you are prepared to fight.

You will be backed by the reinforcements from the military.  They will drop supplies (health, armor, and weapons) occassionally.  If you hear aircraft overhead or see fireworks, head towards the drop zone - but be warned, these areas are NOT safezones.  You may also encounter conflict from other players while obtaining the loot box.  

### TODO

- Figure out a mission
- Offer rewards other than loot
- Decorate the world
- Figure out how to introduce vehicles
- Scoreboard
- Welcome screen (choose character)
