## The Game

### Synopsis
The world has been invaded by nearly indestructable, one-hit killers from outer space.
Upon joining the server, you are part of a group of desperate lone survivors of the invasion whose
only mission is to save the world.   You will be backed by the reinforcements of what remains of the military.  They will drop supplies (health, weapons, vehicles) occassionally.  If you hear aircraft overhead or see fireworks, head towards the drop - but be warned, these areas are NOT safezones.

### Enemies
We do not know much about these alien lifeform.  We only know that they are very difficult to kill. If one of these creatures spots you, they will begin chasing you and will kill you in a single hit.  The best advise is to run away to a safe distance unless you are prepared to fight.
